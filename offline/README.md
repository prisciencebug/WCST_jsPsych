# WCST_JSPsych

<i>Created by the MEMO Team of Lyon Neuroscience Research Center (CRNL) (PI: Dezso Nemeth)</i>

A card sorting task created with the JSPsych library (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-014-0458-y">de Leeuw, J. R., 2015</a>), based on the Berg's Card Sorting Task (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063885">Fox et al., 2013</a>).

<h2>Structure of the task</h2>
<p>In the task, four cards appear on the screen. Each card has a different color, number, and shape property. From left to right, the card properties are the following: 1 red triangle, 2 green stars, 3 yellow diamonds, and 4 blue circles.</p>
<p>Below the four cards, a fifth one appears on the screen. The task is to classify the fifth card to one of the upper cards. The sorting can be done based on the color, number, or shape property. The user can classify the new card by cliking on one of the four cards.</p>
<p>The correct answer depends on a rule (color, number, or shape). The rule is not known by the user. However, a feedback is given to the user after each click (Correct or Wrong).</p>

<p>64 new cards as presented to the user. The rule changes after 10 consecutive correct answers. The order of the rules are: color, shape, number, color, shape, number.</p>

<h2>Setting options</h2>
The language of the task can be set in the parameters.js file by modifying the variable "language".<br>Available languages: english (en), hungarian (hu), french (fr), portuguese (pt)

<h2>How to start the task</h2>
Open the <i>index.html</i> file in either the <i>offline</i> or <i>online</i> folder. When the offline version is started, you can customize the subject and session numbers (any number is accepted). If you start the offline version, a random subject ID will be allocated.

<h2>Browser requirements</h2>
